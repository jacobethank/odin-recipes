    <h1>Creamy Baked Mac and Cheese</h1>
    <p>I found this recipe online a few years ago and made some adjustments to suit my taste. It's definitely fattening, but insanely satisfying and perfect for a holiday meal or get-together.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cavatappi pasta (1lb / one box)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups half and half</li>
        <li>4 cups freshly-shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups freshly-shredded gruyere cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly-shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp. salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 325 degrees and grease a 9x13" baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and cook the cavatappi 1 minute less than the package directs for al dente. Drain and drizzle with a small amount of olive oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>While the water is coming to a boil, shred the cheeses and mix together. Measure out 3 cups for the sauce, and split the remaining amount for the layers in the dish (more on that later).</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Sprinkle in the flour and whisk together. Cook for one minute, whisking often. Slowly pour in your whole milk and half-and-half while whisking, until smooth.</li>
        <li>Continue to heat and whisk very often until thickened to a very thick consistency. You should feel resistance when whisking.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and add in your spices and 1 1/2 cups of the cheeses, stirring until melted and combined. Do the same for another 1 1/2 cups of cheese.</li>
        <li>Add the drained pasta to your sauce, stirring to combine. Pour half of the pasta mixture into the baking dish, covering with 1 1/2 cups of cheese. Add the rest of the pasta and cover with the last 1 1/2 cups of cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes, broiling for the last minute or so to get a nice golden crisp on the top.</li>
    </ol>
