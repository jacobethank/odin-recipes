    <h1>Tuscan Chicken</h1>
    <p>This is one of my family's staple dishes to make, and it's so delicious and satisfying. I've tweaked this recipe over the years and it's pretty much perfect.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Angel hair pasta (enough for a few servings)</li>
        <li>2-3 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>Baby spinach (about a handful)</li>
        <li>1/2 pint of heavy cream</li>
        <li>Splash of chicken broth (optional)</li>
        <li>Half of a yellow onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of garlic</li>
        <li>Salt, pepper, and oregano</li>
        <li>Parmesan</li>
        <li>1 jar of Bella Sun Luci Sun Dried Tomato Bruschetta (or a similar product)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a lightly-oiled skillet or pan to medium high heat. Rinse, trim, and season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and oregano to taste. Cook for 4 minutes on each side, then remove to rest.</li>
        <li>In a bigger, lightly-oiled saucepan, add the onion and garlic with a dash of oregano and cook on medium-low until the onion is translucent.</li>
        <li>While the onions are cooking, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the angel hair and cook for 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add a splash of chicken broth and the jar of bruschetta to the pan, and stir for a minute. Then, add the heavy cream and stir until the sauce becomes a uniform color.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta. Add the spinach to the sauce and stir for a minute until the spinach is wilted. Cut up the chicken and add to the sauce, and stir until everything is well-mixed.</li>
        <li>Top with grated Parmesan cheese and serve with the pasta.</li>
    </ol>
